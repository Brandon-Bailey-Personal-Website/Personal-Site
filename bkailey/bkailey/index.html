        When you find yourself in a rut, it’s often unclear what needs to change. You may have a good paying job, a loving family, and supportive partner. Even when your life looks good on paper, you still feel unfulfilled. You go through the motions, but something is missing.
        
        In some cases, change seems way too overwhelming. One problem piles on top of the next, and it feels like every day, you constantly have to put out fires. When nothing goes right, you may feel frozen and scared to make the next move. 
        
        Wherever you find yourself, it can feel confusing to pinpoint where you’re at versus where you want to be. To get a clear idea of how to build a meaningful life, you first need to clarify what exactly needs to change. 
        
        So, what is your life like today?
        
        Ask yourself some hard-hitting questions to learn where you stand right now—to find out what is working and what needs to change.
